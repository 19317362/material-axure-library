# How to use it?

1. You should install Roboto and FontAwesome font, because I use Roboto as the main font and FontAwesome as the iconic font.
2. Download the Axure library file [here](https://github.com/duzyn/material-axure-library/blob/master/MaterialDesign.rplib?raw=true)
3. Open your Axure, click the three bars icon and choose "Load Library". Find the library file to Load it.
4. That's all! You can now enjoy your time for making some Material Design prototypes.

# To do

- Thumbnails. I'm not good at icon making if you can fork my repo and contribute to it, I will appreciate it.
- Chinese version. I'm a Chinese, the Noto Sans S Chinese is the recommened CJK font used in Android.
